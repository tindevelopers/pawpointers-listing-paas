|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Admin** | | ✅ Visible | |
| ├─ User Management | `/saas/admin/entity/user-management` | ✅ Works | `requirePermission("users.read")` + RLS |

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Manages THEIR organization only** - RLS enforces `tenant_id` filtering
- ✅ **User & team management** - Can manage users within their org
- ✅ **Organization settings** - Can configure org-level settings
- ✅ **Staff operations** - Can onboard/offboard users
- ✅ **Cannot see other orgs** - RLS policies prevent cross-tenant access
- ❌ **Cannot access Platform Admin routes** - Permission checks block access

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### ✅ Permission System
- **Platform Admin Detection**: ✅ Working (`role_id = "Platform Admin"` AND `tenant_id = NULL`)
- **Permission Checks**: ✅ Server actions use `requirePermission()`
- **RLS Bypass**: ✅ Platform Admin uses `createAdminClient()` to bypass RLS
- **Tenant Isolation**: ✅ Organization Admin restricted by RLS policies

### ✅ Route Protection
- **Server Actions**: ✅ Protected with `requirePermission()`
- **Database Queries**: ✅ RLS policies enforce tenant isolation
- **UI Components**: ✅ Use `PermissionGate` for conditional rendering

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **Menu Filtering**: Currently all menus visible to all users (UX issue, not security issue)
2. **Route Guards**: Could add page-level permission checks for better UX
3. **Error Handling**: Could improve error messages for permission denials

## 📊 Test Results

### Platform Admin (`systemadmin@tin.info`)
- ✅ Can access all routes
- ✅ Sees all tenants/organizations/users
- ✅ No permission errors
- ✅ Bypasses RLS correctly

### Organization Admin
- ✅ Can access org-level routes
- ❌ Gets "Insufficient permissions" for Platform Admin routes
- ✅ RLS restricts data to their `tenant_id`
- ✅ Cannot see other organizations

---

## ✅ Final Confirmation

**All menus are functional and properly secured:**

1. ✅ **Routes exist** for all menu items
2. ✅ **Permission checks** are in place at server action level
3. ✅ **RLS policies** enforce tenant isolation
4. ✅ **Platform Admin** has full access
5. ✅ **Organization Admin** is properly restricted

**The system correctly implements the role hierarchy:**
- Platform Admin = Full platform control ✅
- Organization Admin = Organization-level control ✅
