# Role Naming Updates - Google/HubSpot Style

## Summary of Changes

Updated role names to match Google Workspace and HubSpot's organization scheme for better clarity and industry alignment.

## Role Name Changes

| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Platform Admin | **Platform Admin** (unchanged) | Already matches "Tenant Admin" concept - full platform control |
| Workspace Admin | **Organization Admin** | Better reflects managing an organization/company within the platform |
| Billing Owner | **Billing Owner** (unchanged) | Clear and matches industry standard |
| Developer | **Developer** (unchanged) | Clear and matches industry standard |
| Viewer | **Viewer** (unchanged) | Clear and matches industry standard |
